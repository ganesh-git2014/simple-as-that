simple-as-that
==============

The simplest (and easier) static site generator 


# Super easy to use:
1. Put your template html file in templates (ex: templates/template-main.html)
2. Create a directory (template-main/) inside templates/ 
3. Put your posts there in a python dictionary format (look one.that)
4. Run ./simpleasthat and inside your templates/template-main/output you would see your final jtml

Awesome!
